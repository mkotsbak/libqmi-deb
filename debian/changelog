libqmi (1.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Marius B. Kotsbak ]
  * New upstream stable release 1.2.0
    - Builds with Python3
    - Fixed DMS activation code string handling
    - Enhanced "start network" functionality in qmicli
  * Drop patches applied upstream:
    - "qmi-codegen-clean-up-compiled-python-files_git_1822155"
    - "cli-all-sources-are-GPLv2_git_a5631ea"
  * Updated control Vcs-* fields to point to the Alioth hosted project
  * Corrected debian/copyright: cli/* and libqmi-glib/test/* are GPL 2+.
    Changed packaging to GPL 2+ too, as LGPL does not make sense here.
  * Added help2man generating of manpages (new debian/rules target
    "generate_manpages:". Edited result for qmi-network as it lacked
    complete help. Workaround for upstream bgo #58755.
